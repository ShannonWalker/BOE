                                When I was asked by preservationist Marie Beirne to make a short video promotion for the effort to attain landmark status for Stuyvesant Town,
                                like most people I’d only known the complex to be an expansive housing “project” for the middle class, albeit, a successful one -- the apartments
                                had a ten year waiting list. For over fourteen years I lived only three short blocks south of  Stuyvesant Town and would walk past it everyday,
                                thinking how regimented and off-putting it looked from 14th street. Not once in those fourteen years, did I venture inside the complex. Then, one very
                                hot summer morning, I found myself running late on my way back home from mid-town. The possibility of a shortcut from 16th street to Ave A prompted
                                me to take my first step inside. It took only two minutes to expose the inaccuracy of my perception of Stuyvesant Town. I sensed immediate  relief from a
                                drop of at least ten degrees in the temperature which, I realized, must result from the surrounding forest of trees. So much green I’d never imaged to exist
                                beyond the brick walls. And the sudden quiet: a genuine removal from the Manhattan din. The next day I requested an application.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Even after I moved into Stuyvesant Town, however, I had no real clue about its rich history and significance. So when I began to do research
                                and  to interview people for the video promotion I  found myself in a near, constant state of  wonder. I experienced one epiphany after another
                                in terms of  the extraordinary degree to which Stuyvesant Town played critical roles in the areas of post-WWII politics, urban planning, the civil rights
                                movement, and architecture.
                            </p>

                                Stuyvesant Town is massive: 11,000 people displaced from the condemned Gas House District to make way for construction, 36.5 million bricks,
                                42,000 piles driven in to the ground, 11,000 apartments, 110,000 application letters received before it opened. These numbers (and many more) are
                                and remain huge. But that doesn’t tell the real story nor convey the significance of this place. Sure it’s big, but more importantly, Stuyvesant Town
                                claims a number of  paramount <i><b>“Firsts.”</b></i>

                                It was the first public-private venture in urban renewal whereby the government acquired the 16 acres (!) of Manhattan real estate for  the richest
                                corporation in the country at the time, Metropolitan Insurance Company. Metropolitan (now Met Life), was to  build the massive complex with the understanding it
                                would keep the rents at a certain middle class level and in return would receive 25 years worth of tax breaks.  While Mayor Fiorello H. LaGuardia
                                and members of his administration, most notably, Robert Moses, saw this as a practical solution to a severe housing problem, their opponents
                                took the longer view that public monies (e.g.,  tax breaks and the first use of “eminent domain”)  should not pave the way for private profit.
                                This conflict regarding the funding of urban redevelopment was playing out on  the state and federal levels as well and resulted in numerous compromise
                                pieces of legislation.

                                It was the “First” instance of a post modernist European design conceit that sought to utilize hi-rise building technology to achieve more space
                                and light, an approach the French architect Le Corbusier termed “Towers In the Park.” As my initial walk into the complex attests, it remains one of
                                the more successful examples of that approach to urban design.

                                New York’s-- and the nation’s-- “First” fair-housing law resulted from Stuyvesant Town being the battleground of a bitter fight to desegregate
                                Met Life’s Whites Only complex.  After numerous failed law suits on behalf of black veterans, a group of Stuyvesant Town tenants banded together to
                                bring in the first black family to the complex by inviting them to stay in their apartments as guests. Met Life retaliated with eviction notices. The
                                tenants barricaded themselves in their apartments and food got lifted up to their windows. Burly Teamsters were brought in to protect them from physical
                                eviction, while mothers with their babies in carriages picketed at the Met Life building. It was a true David and Goliath story that not only resulted in historic
                                legislation but set a precedent for collective action.

                                And, of course, recently, (in more of a most than a first), Stuyvestant Town was the prime object of  speculative real estate investment during the madness
                                of the housing bubble. It fetched the highest price ($5.4 billion) ever paid for a residential property, touted as the “Largest Real Estate Transaction
                                in World History.”

                                What started out as a short landmarking promotion has developed into  this film, <b>The Burden of Eden</b>, which tells some of the stories of these
                                critical firsts through the voices of those who were there. Along with Marie Beirne, who is now my co-producer, we’ve had the privilege of  being
                                invited into the homes of many first, second and third generation tenants for interviews to help construct these stories.  Further, <b>The Burden of Eden</b> 
                                underscores how the future of a unique and important complex born of the idea of  “private enterprise productively devoted to public service”  remains vulnerable to unchecked
                                market force.

                                Foreseeing a severe housing shortage after WWII, the City of New York and Metropolitan Life Insurance Company,
                                the world’s richest corporation at the time, form the first public-private partnership to build Stuyvesant Town and create
                                a model for cleaning up blighted urban areas, eventually  known as “slum clearance.”  The City condemns “the Gas House
                                district,” and creates the largest forced migration in its history so that Metropolitan can build  Stuyvesant Town, the goal of which
                                is to maintain affordable housing for thousands of returning war veterans and their families, thereby keeping a viable middle
                                class from fleeing to the suburbs. However,  Stuyvesant Town’s “whites only” policy does not sit well with many returning
                                veterans who, had just seen first hand the results of racism in Nazi Germany, and had fought alongside African American
                                soldiers. A long,  bitter struggle to end the exclusionary policy results in the New York City Council  passing the Brown Isaacs bill,
                                the first fair housing law--not just in NYC, but in the nation. Also,  the protest actions set a precedent for the mass demonstrations of
                                the sixties civil rights movement. Although it takes longer than it should have, integration eventually arrives at Stuyvesant Town.

                                The post-war idealism that was the impetus to create and maintain new affordable housing in Manhattan for the middle class found
                                its design parallel in early 20th Century European modernist, indeed utopian, aesthetics (“Towers in the Park”);  the complex combines
                                high rise buildings and open spaces in order to bring the light and air of the suburbs into the city. Drastically divergent opinions emerge
                                about the design. Among its detractors, Luis Mumford describes it as  “the architecture of the police state.”  As the years pass, however,
                                thousands of trees mature and come to dominate the landscape, transforming the harshness of massive block housing into a what its
                                creators had envisioned: the trees and open spaces creating a park-like setting. Today,  Stuyvesant Town stands as one of the most
                                successful projects of “urban renewal”  and remains requisite study for students of history, architecture and urban planning. The
                                complex has succeeded in ways that surpass even its creators’ dreams. Will that success, however, prove its undoing?

                                The shared experience of the Veterans and their families coupled with the layout of the complex led to something which neither Robert Moses
                                nor Jane Jacobs could have predicted: an extraordinarily tight-knit sense of community among the residents  which would last over multiple generations.
                                Such a concentration of young families  and exploding birth rates (the complex become known as “Rabbit Town”) guaranteed social continuity among the
                                adults and, as the children went to the same schools throughout their formative years, succeeding generations. A small town ethos developed amid the
                                residents whose shared sense of community was evident as early as 1952 when six hundred of them, mostly women and children, showed up at City
                                Hall to protest Met Life’s proposed first rent increase. It continues today as residents band tightly together in a powerful tenants association to maintain
                                the original premise of the complex as described by then Met Life Chairman, Frederick Ecker: <b> “...that families of moderate means might live in health,
                                comfort and dignity in park-like communities, and that a pattern might be set of private enterprise productively devoted to public service."</b>
